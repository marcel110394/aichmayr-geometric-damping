# Geometric Regularization via Damping

This repository accompanies the Zenodo publication:

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17980982


The work introduces a geometrical damping framework applied to
Schwarzschild-type metrics, defining finite-scale transitions,
core regularization, and an effective φ-regime as a structural layer
beyond microscopic breakdown.

This repository serves **documentation, integrity verification,
and reproducibility purposes only**.
The authoritative version of record is the Zenodo DOI.
