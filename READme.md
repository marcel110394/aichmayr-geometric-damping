This repository contains the LaTeX source for the paper

"Geometric Regularization via Damping: Finite-Scale Transitions and the φ-Regime".



The work introduces a scale-regularized metric framework, distinguishes

exponential damping from core regularization, and defines a mathematically

explicit criterion for the breakdown of microscopic descriptions.



No claims of energy creation or violation of conservation laws are made.

The framework is intended to be falsifiable and phenomenological.
